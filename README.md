dproxy - A ~Dumb~ Docker Proxy
==============================

This is dproxy, a ridiculously stupid nginx-based proxy for a
single Docker host to use labels to set up front-end, TLS routes.
It is designed to be used with Let's Encrypt using something like
the DNS-01 challenge (to get a wildcard certificate).

It has two interesting parts:

`/bin/dump-docker` is meant to be run outside of the dproxy
container, where it is safe to access the Docker socket (by
running `docker` commands).  Its output gets piped into...

`/bin/reconfigure-nginx`, which is meant to be run from _inside_
the dproxy container.  It reads the JSON produced by
`dump-docker`, writes a new configuration for nginx, and then
either reloads nginx to pick up the changes, or scraps it as a
no-op.

Reloading nginx is done via the `bin/reload-nginx` program, which
just trawls through `/proc/*/cmdline` looking for the nginx:
master process string.  It's dumb, but it works when nginx itself
is containerized (and therefore /proc/$pid is fairly small).

It is safe to run this process from the Docker host on a fairly
agressive schedule.  Doing so will exercise the Docker daemon
itself, but the built-in safeguards of dproxy will prevent wild
thrashing of the nginx processâ€“unless you are wildly spinning up
new (labeled) containers.

That brings us to the routing itself.  To get dproxy to start
routing traffic to a container, add the following labels:

*com.huntprod.docker.route* - the Host: header you want to route
to this container, and

*com.huntprod.docker.port* - the port, forwarded on loopback, that
will respond to the host-bound nginx process.

Here's a sketch of an operational deployment of dproxy:

```
#!/bin/sh
set -eu

docker run \
  --restart=always \
  --name dproxy \
  --network host \
  huntprod/dproxy &

docker run --rm huntprod/dproxy \
  cat /usr/bin/dump-docker \      # from inside the image
    > /usr/bin/dump-docker        #    ... to the outside!
chmod 0755 /usr/bin/dump-docker

# assuming jq is already installed...

while true; do
  sleep 1
  dump-docker | docker exec -i dproxy reconfigure-nginx
done
```
